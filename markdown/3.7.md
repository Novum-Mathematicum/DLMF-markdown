where $f$ , $g$ , and $h$ are analytic functions in a domain $D\subset\mathbb{C}$ . If $h=0$ the differential equation is *homogeneous* , otherwise it is *inhomogeneous* . For applications to special functions $f$ , $g$ , and $h$ are often simple rational functions.

Assume that we wish to integrate ( 3.7.1 ) along a finite path $\mathscr{P}$ from $z=a$ to $z=b$ in a domain $D$ . The path is partitioned at $P+1$ points labeled successively $z_{0},z_{1},\dots,z_{P}$ , with $z_{0}=a$ , $z_{P}=b$ .

By repeated differentiation of ( 3.7.1 ) all derivatives of $w(z)$ can be expressed in terms of $w(z)$ and $w^{\prime}(z)$ as follows. Write

If the solution $w(z)$ that we are seeking grows in magnitude at least as fast as all other solutions of ( 3.7.1 ) as we pass along $\mathscr{P}$ from $a$ to $b$ , then $w(z)$ and $w^{\prime}(z)$ may be computed in a stable manner for $z=z_{0},z_{1},\dots,z_{P}$ by successive application of ( 3.7.5 ) for $j=0,1,\dots,P-1$ , beginning with initial values $w(a)$ and $w^{\prime}(a)$ .

Similarly, if $w(z)$ is decaying at least as fast as all other solutions along $\mathscr{P}$ , then we may reverse the labeling of the $z_{j}$ along $\mathscr{P}$ and begin with initial values $w(b)$ and $w^{\prime}(b)$ .

Now suppose the path $\mathscr{P}$ is such that the rate of growth of $w(z)$ along $\mathscr{P}$ is intermediate to that of two other solutions. (This can happen only for inhomogeneous equations.) Then to compute $w(z)$ in a stable manner we solve the set of equations ( 3.7.5 ) simultaneously for $j=0,1,\dots,P$ , as follows. Let $\mathbf{A}_{P}$ be the $(2P)\times(2P+2)$ band matrix


<a id="E10"></a>
$$
\mathbf{A}_{P}=\begin{bmatrix}-\mathbf{A}(\tau_{0},z_{0})&\mathbf{I}&\boldsymbol{{0}}&\cdots&\boldsymbol{{0}}&\boldsymbol{{0}}\\
\boldsymbol{{0}}&-\mathbf{A}(\tau_{1},z_{1})&\mathbf{I}&\cdots&\boldsymbol{{0}}&\boldsymbol{{0}}\\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots\\
\boldsymbol{{0}}&\boldsymbol{{0}}&\cdots&-\mathbf{A}(\tau_{P-2},z_{P-2})&\mathbf{I}&\boldsymbol{{0}}\\
\boldsymbol{{0}}&\boldsymbol{{0}}&\cdots&\boldsymbol{{0}}&-\mathbf{A}(\tau_{P-1},z_{P-1})&\mathbf{I}\end{bmatrix} \tag{3.7.10}
$$

( $\mathbf{I}$ and $\boldsymbol{{0}}$ being the identity and zero matrices of order $2\times 2$ .) Also let $\mathbf{w}$ denote the $(2P+2)\times 1$ vector


<a id="E11"></a>
$$
\mathbf{w}=\left[w(z_{0}),w^{\prime}(z_{0}),w(z_{1}),w^{\prime}(z_{1}),\dots,w(z_{P}),w^{\prime}(z_{P})\right]^{\rm T}, \tag{3.7.11}
$$

and $\mathbf{b}$ the $(2P)\times 1$ vector


<a id="E12"></a>
$$
\mathbf{b}=\left[b_{1}(\tau_{0},z_{0}),b_{2}(\tau_{0},z_{0}),b_{1}(\tau_{1},z_{1}),b_{2}(\tau_{1},z_{1}),\ldots,b_{1}(\tau_{P-1},z_{P-1}),b_{2}(\tau_{P-1},z_{P-1})\right]^{\rm T}. \tag{3.7.12}
$$

Then


<a id="E13"></a>
$$
\mathbf{A}_{P}\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{b}. \tag{3.7.13}
$$

This is a set of $2P$ equations for the $2P+2$ unknowns, $w(z_{j})$ and $w^{\prime}(z_{j})$ , $j=0,1,\dots,P$ . The remaining two equations are supplied by boundary conditions of the form

where the $\alpha$ ’s, $\beta$ ’s, and $\gamma$ ’s are constants.

If, for example, $\beta_{0}=\beta_{1}=0$ , then on moving the contributions of $w(z_{0})$ and $w(z_{P})$ to the right-hand side of ( 3.7.13 ) the resulting system of equations is not tridiagonal, but can readily be made tridiagonal by annihilating the elements of $\mathbf{A}_{P}$ that lie below the main diagonal and its two adjacent diagonals. The equations can then be solved by the method of § 3.2(ii) , if the differential equation is homogeneous, or by Olver’s algorithm (§ 3.6(v) ). The latter is especially useful if the endpoint $b$ of $\mathscr{P}$ is at $\infty$ , or if the differential equation is inhomogeneous.

It will be observed that the present formulation of the Taylor-series method permits considerable parallelism in the computation, both for initial-value and boundary-value problems.

Let $(a,b)$ be a finite or infinite interval and $q(x)$ be a real-valued continuous (or piecewise continuous) function on the closure of $(a,b)$ . The *Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem* is the construction of a nontrivial solution of the system


<a id="E15"></a>
$$
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}w_{k}}{{\mathrm{d}x}^{2}}+(\lambda_{k}-q(x))w_{k}=0, \tag{3.7.15}
$$


<a id="E16"></a>
$$
w_{k}(a)=w_{k}(b)=0, \tag{3.7.16}
$$

with limits taken in ( 3.7.16 ) when $a$ or $b$ , or both, are infinite. The values $\lambda_{k}$ are the *eigenvalues* and the corresponding solutions $w_{k}$ of the differential equation are the *eigenfunctions* . The eigenvalues $\lambda_{k}$ are simple, that is, there is only one corresponding eigenfunction (apart from a normalization factor), and when ordered increasingly the eigenvalues satisfy


<a id="E17"></a>
$$
\lambda_{1}<\lambda_{2}<\lambda_{3}<\cdots, \tag{3.7.17}
$$

If $q(x)$ is $C^{\infty}$ on the closure of $(a,b)$ , then the discretized form ( 3.7.13 ) of the differential equation can be used. This converts the problem into a tridiagonal matrix problem in which the elements of the matrix are polynomials in $\lambda$ ; compare § 3.2(vi) . The larger the absolute values of the eigenvalues $\lambda_{k}$ that are being sought, the smaller the integration steps $\left|\tau_{j}\right|$ need to be.

The Runge–Kutta method applies to linear or nonlinear differential equations. The method consists of a set of rules each of which is equivalent to a truncated Taylor-series expansion, but the rules avoid the need for analytic differentiations of the differential equation.
