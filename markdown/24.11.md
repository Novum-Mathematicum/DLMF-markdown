Erratum (V1.0.11) for References

**Replacement (effective with 1.0.11):**

In the sentence at the end of this section the original reference to López and Temme ([1999b](./bib/L.html#bib1454 "Hermite polynomials in asymptotic representations of generalized Bernoulli, Euler, Bessel, and Buchholz polynomials")) was replaced with a reference to López and Temme ([1999c](./bib/L.html#bib2875 "Uniform approximations of Bernoulli and Euler polynomials in terms of hyperbolic functions")). (The reference to López and Temme ([1999b](./bib/L.html#bib1454 "Hermite polynomials in asymptotic representations of generalized Bernoulli, Euler, Bessel, and Buchholz polynomials")) was moved to § 24.16(i) .)
